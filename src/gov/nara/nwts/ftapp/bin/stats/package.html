<p>The results of each {@link gov.nara.nwts.ftapp.filetest.FileTest} can be highly customized to meet a specific business need.</p>  
<p>A companion to each Stats object is a Stats description object implemented as Object[][].  The first dimension correlates to a column of output that will be displayed for each Stats object.  The second dimension is used as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class of the object that will be displayed.  The class will most commonly be a String, Int, Long, Date or Enum.</li>
<li>Column header to display</li>
<li>Width of the column </li>
<li>Filter values (in the GUI, a drop down will be created if present)</li>
</ul>
<p>Flag to indicate whether or not to save the column by default when exporting results.</p>
