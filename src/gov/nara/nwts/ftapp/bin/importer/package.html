<p>This package contains custom file import rules that can be invoked from the File Analyzer.  </p>
<p>The primary reason for providing import functionality is to support the match/merge capabilities of the File Analyzer GUI.</p>
<p>As new import rules are created, the File Analyzer could also serve as an ingest tool.</p>
