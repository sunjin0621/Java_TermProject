<p>This package contains the Graphical User Interface elements of the File Analyzer.</p>  
<p>Note: In order to provide a responsive user experience, long-running actions to be performed within a Java GUI should occur in a worker thread that periodically updates its status to the GUI application thread.  Several functions that are straightforward in the command line mode of the File Analyzer, have been decomposed into worker thread and GUI thread actions.</p>
